A list of issues, limitations and potential solutions:

# Windows: (issue) in 'qdialogs' example the 'hide details' button doesn't work properly in the message box windows
# Windows: (polish) Shadow size on windows hidpi too small
# Windows: (issue) Moving windows between screens with different scaling settings corrupts the window
#          Root cause is the frameless_window_hint. Windows with regular Windows titlebars / frames do not have this problem.
#          Proposed solution: when the window is dragged in mouseMoveEvent detect - before it happens - if any of the window's
#          pixels would end up being drawn on a screen with a different scaling. In this case pop the entire window all at once
#          onto the target screen - avoiding that the window is drawn on screens with different scale factors at the same time. i.e.
#          the window can only ever be drawn on a single screen. Needs a solution if the user has 3 montors though (?)
#          Note: example code (commented out) exists as as a proof of concept (keyPressEvent in windowstyle.modernwindow.py)
# MacOS: (polish) add SVG icons in window buttons to mimic macOS better
# MacOS, Linux: (polish) add better cursors for window resizing. Current ones are low-res
# MacOS, Linux: (issue) ffplayer example minimize doesn't always fully resize down to original size on macos. QtModernRedux problem or Qt in general?
# All: (polish) insert a small area to the right of the tabbar for dragging the window in situations where the tabbar takes up the entire titlebar width.
# All: (polish) window buttons (min, max, close) should go grey (i.e. into a disabled state) when window loses focus
# All: (polish) Write API docs
